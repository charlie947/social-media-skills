## What are Skills?

Skills are markdown files that give AI agents specialised knowledge and workflows for specific tasks. When you install these in your project, Claude recognises when you're working on a social media task and applies the right patterns, voice rules, and platform constraints.

## How Skills Work Together

Every skill reads shared context. The `voice-builder` skill is the foundation. Every other skill checks it first (via `about-me.md` and `voice.md`) before drafting a line.

## Usage

Run `voice-builder` first. Every other skill needs `about-me.md` and `voice.md` to work properly.

Once installed, ask Claude to help with content tasks and it will pick the right skill:

```
"Build my voice" → voice-builder
"Write me a post about AI agents" → post-writer
"Score this draft against my history" → post-scorer
"Make me a carousel from this" → gemini-carousel
"What should I post this week" → perplexity-research or content-matrix
"Turn this outlier Reel into a script" → reels-scripting
"I need a thumbnail for 'How I fired my team'" → youtube-thumbnail
"Write me a pinned comment" → pinned-comment
```
